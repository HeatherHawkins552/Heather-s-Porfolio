My dad loved boats, music, all sorts of things. But at some point, those dreams all died as the reality of the American Dream or lack thereof settled in. And it's been 25+ years of staticness. We are just a poor, immigrant family struggling to get year to year. My mom barely has friends here because she can barely speak english, and it is just so depressing. And so my entire life, I've worked so hard, studied so hard, etc. etc. at WFU on scholarship trying to become a doctor, and make a lot of money so that they don't ever feel like their sacrifices to come to America were not worth it. I want them to feel like they made a good decision coming here to the U.S. to a place that has only caused them struggle.

I realized that my father did not want to take care of me, especially in college. He said he didn't owe me anything and that it is up to me to take care of myself even though I had just recently moved out and trying to figure things out. My father divorced my mother and left me and my brother in a tough place. My mother lost her job the same day and it was very hard for us to fend for ourselves. He makes 6 figures and has started another family. We visit him every now and then, well my brother does since I have moved out but it is hard. My dad does the absolute bare minimum and seems to forget that we're his own blood. I feel as if my father owes me some things especially since I have made it this far barely without his help. He can be very spiteful and just doesn't seem to genuinely care about me at all. It was tremendously hard for him to say the things he did and try to belittle me the way that he did. To this day he still doesn't see what he did wrong and probably expects me to apologize. Oh, also this argument started because I asked him to help split or give a little bit of money for my tuition which was about $7,000 and even just a little bit of money would've helped us. He flat-out told me no when he is sitting on top of a lot of money and not even doing anything with it.
